An sbt plugin to format your Scala source files with Scalariform.

This is a very early version. But it works on my dummy test project :-)

Note: the plugin forks a new VM to invoke Scalariform; this is not by design but required, since sbt project definitions are compiled against Scala 2.7.7, while Scalariform uses 2.8.0.RC6.

TODO:
* batch invocations instead of forking a new process for each source file.
* add support for -t (still making -i the default if nothing is specified) and -v.
