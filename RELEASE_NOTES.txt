1.0.3 (2011-05-02)
- Upgrade to Scalariform 0.0.9.
- Upgrade sbt to 0.7.5.
- Use Scala 2.8.1 to execute Scalariform.

Known issue:
  the MaxArrowIndent option doesn't work. This seems to be a problem
  with Scalariform itself. I've opened issue #20 on the project
  (https://github.com/mdr/scalariform/issues/20).

1.0.2 (2010-10-21)
- Upgrade to Scalariform 0.0.7.
- New option to disable automatic formatting.

1.0.1 (2010-08-25)
- Better handling of the Scalariform dependency.
- Tested and documented multi-modules setups.
- Hook to specify source file encoding.

Important note:
  this version depends on a snapshot version of Scalariform. This is
  due to a circular dependency between the two projects.
  In the future, I'll be more careful not to depend on unreleased features
  of Scalariform, so that the plugin always depends on a stable version.

1.0.0 (2010-07-19)
- First release.
