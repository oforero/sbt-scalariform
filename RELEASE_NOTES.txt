1.0.2 (2010-10-21)
- Upgrade to Scalariform 0.0.7.
- New option to disable automatic formatting.

1.0.1 (2010-08-25)
- Better handling of the Scalariform dependency.
- Tested and documented multi-modules setups.
- Hook to specify source file encoding.

Important note:
  this version depends on a snapshot version of Scalariform. This is
  due to a circular dependency between the two projects.
  In the future, I'll be more careful not to depend on unreleased features
  of Scalariform, so that the plugin always depends on a stable version.

1.0.0 (2010-07-19)
- First release.
